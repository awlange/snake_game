# Snake Game

Classic snake game made with phaser.js.

Can be run with the simple node.js [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) like so:

```
http-server snake_game
```

And then you can view and play the game on `localhost:8080`.

This was just a project for me to experiment with writing a web video game and see how the phaser.js library works.
